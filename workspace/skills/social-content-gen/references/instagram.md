# Instagram Content Rules

## Caption Limits
- **Maximum**: 2,200 characters
- **Ideal feed post**: 125-150 chars (above-fold hook) + 800-1,500 chars body
- **First line is everything** -- it shows before "...more" is tapped

## Post Structure
1. **Hook** (first line) -- compelling, emotional, or surprising. No hashtags here.
2. **Body** -- value, story, insight, or educational content
3. **CTA** (call to action) -- save this post, share with a friend, comment below, link in bio
4. **Hashtag block** -- separated by 5 line breaks OR placed in first comment

## Hashtag Strategy
- Maximum 30 hashtags (Instagram limit)
- Recommended: 15-20 for optimal reach
- Mix ratio:
  - 5 broad hashtags (500K+ posts) for discovery
  - 5 medium hashtags (50K-500K posts) for competition balance
  - 5 niche hashtags (<50K posts) for targeted reach
- Never use banned or spammy hashtags
- Consider moving hashtags to first comment (cleaner look)

## Formatting
- Use line breaks liberally -- double-space creates paragraph breaks
- Emojis encouraged as bullet points, emphasis markers, or decoration
- Links are NOT clickable in captions -- always say "link in bio"
- Use periods (.) on empty lines to create visual spacing

## Tone & Style
- Authentic and personal
- Visual language (describe what the viewer sees/feels)
- Storytelling performs best (beginning, middle, end)
- Ask questions to drive comments
- Use "you" and "we" language for connection
- Behind-the-scenes content resonates

## Content Type Variations
- **Carousel**: Mention "swipe" or "slide" in caption, promise value across slides
- **Reel**: Short hook-driven description, trending audio reference
- **Story**: Ephemeral, casual, use polls/questions/sliders for engagement
- **Photo post**: Aesthetic, caption-driven narrative

## What NOT to Do
- Don't start with hashtags
- Don't use more than 30 hashtags
- Don't paste links in the caption (they're not clickable)
- Don't write walls of text without line breaks
- Don't be overly salesy in every post
