# Telegram Content Rules

## Message Limits
- **Maximum**: 4,096 characters per message
- No practical limit on content depth -- Telegram readers expect substance

## Formatting (HTML supported)
Telegram supports rich formatting:
- **Bold**: `<b>text</b>` or `**text**`
- *Italic*: `<i>text</i>` or `*text*`
- `Code`: `` `inline code` `` or `<code>text</code>`
- Code block: triple backticks with language
- ~~Strikethrough~~: `<s>text</s>` or `~~text~~`
- Underline: `<u>text</u>`
- Links: `[text](url)` or `<a href="url">text</a>`
- Spoilers: `||spoiler text||`

## Structure
- **Long-form content welcome** -- Telegram users expect depth
- Use bold section headers with line breaks
- Bullet points with `-` or `*` characters
- Numbered lists for step-by-step content
- Code blocks for technical content
- Separate sections with blank lines

## Hashtags
- **Not part of Telegram culture** -- skip them entirely
- Use bold section headers instead of hashtags for organization
- Searchability comes from content, not tags

## Tone & Style
- Can be any tone (depends on channel/audience)
- More in-depth and informative than other platforms
- Newsletter-style writing works well
- Direct and educational
- Can include links freely (they're clickable!)
- Can reference external resources extensively

## Content Types
- **Channel post** (one-way broadcast): Well-structured, article-like
- **Group message** (conversational): More casual, discussion-oriented
- **Formatted article**: Rich formatting with links, code, headers
- **Quick update**: Brief, informative, with relevant links
- **Tutorial/guide**: Step-by-step with code blocks and examples

## What Works
- Rich formatting makes content scannable
- Links are first-class citizens (unlike Instagram/TikTok)
- Longer, more detailed content is appreciated
- Media (images, documents, files) can accompany text
- Pinned messages for important content

## What NOT to Do
- Don't add hashtags (Telegram doesn't use them)
- Don't write overly short, tweet-like messages (wastes the format)
- Don't skip formatting -- plain walls of text are hard to read
- Don't forget that links are clickable here (use them!)
