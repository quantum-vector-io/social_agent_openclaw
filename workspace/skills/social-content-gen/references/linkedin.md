# LinkedIn Content Rules

## Post Limits
- **Maximum**: 3,000 characters
- **Ideal**: 1,200-1,800 characters for maximum engagement
- **First 2-3 lines** visible before "...see more" -- this is your hook

## Post Structure
1. **Hook** -- bold statement, provocative question, or surprising statistic
2. **Context** -- personal story, industry observation, or data point
3. **Key Points** -- 3-5 numbered or bulleted items (the "meat")
4. **Takeaway** -- one clear lesson or insight
5. **CTA** -- ask a question to invite discussion ("What's your experience?")
6. **Hashtags** -- 3-5 at the very end

## Formatting
- **Short paragraphs**: 1-2 sentences each
- **One sentence per line** for readability (LinkedIn's algorithm favors this)
- Use numbered lists or bullet points for scanability
- Bold text via `**text**` is NOT natively supported -- use CAPS sparingly for emphasis
- Leave blank lines between paragraphs

## Hashtag Strategy
- 3-5 relevant hashtags only
- Mix: 1 branded + 2-3 industry + 1 topic-specific
- Place at the end, never inline
- Popular LinkedIn hashtags often include #Leadership, #Innovation, #CareerAdvice

## Tone & Style
- **Professional but personable** -- not corporate-speak
- Thought leadership: share opinions backed by experience, not just facts
- First-person narrative ("I learned...", "In my experience...")
- Educational and actionable content
- Vulnerability and honest stories perform well
- "I" statements for personal brand content

## Content Types
- **Text post**: Most common, best organic reach
- **Document/carousel**: PDF slides (high engagement, educational)
- **Article**: Long-form (lower reach but SEO value)
- **Poll**: High engagement driver
- **Video**: Short, professional, with captions

## What Works Well
- "I got fired / I failed / I was wrong" stories (vulnerability)
- Contrarian takes on common industry beliefs
- Framework or methodology sharing (numbered steps)
- Celebrating others' achievements (generous content)
- Lessons from real experience (not theoretical)

## What NOT to Do
- Don't use clickbait (LinkedIn actively penalizes it)
- Don't use excessive emojis (1-2 max, if any)
- Don't hashtag-stuff (5+ looks spammy)
- Don't write in corporate jargon ("synergize", "leverage")
- Don't post links in the body (kills reach) -- put link in comments
