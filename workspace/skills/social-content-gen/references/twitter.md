# X/Twitter Content Rules

## Character Limits
- **Single tweet**: 280 characters (URLs count ~23 chars)
- **Thread**: Unlimited tweets, each 280 chars
- **Premium users**: 25,000 chars (but 280 gets better reach)

## Single Tweet Structure
1. **Hook** or strong opinion (first ~100 chars are critical)
2. **Value or insight** -- one clear point
3. **Hashtags** -- 1-2 inline or at end (optional)

## Thread Structure
1. **Tweet 1**: Hook + signal it's a thread ("Thread" or "A thread on...")
2. **Tweets 2-N**: One idea per tweet, each self-contained but flowing
3. **Last tweet**: Summary + CTA ("Follow for more", "RT if useful", "Bookmark this")
- Number tweets for long threads (1/, 2/, etc.)
- Each tweet should be interesting enough to stand alone

## Formatting
- Plain text only (no rich formatting)
- Line breaks for emphasis and pacing
- Emojis as visual anchors (sparingly)
- ALL CAPS for 1-2 words max emphasis (never full sentences)

## Hashtag Strategy
- **1-2 maximum** (more looks spammy on Twitter)
- Use trending hashtags only when genuinely relevant
- Cashtags ($TICKER) for finance content
- Often better to skip hashtags entirely for organic feel

## Tone & Style
- **Punchy, direct, opinionated**
- Hot takes and contrarian views perform well
- Conversational, like talking to a smart friend
- Wit and humor are highly valued
- Be concise -- every single word must earn its place at 280 chars
- Strong verbs, no filler words

## Content Types
- **Single tweet**: Quick takes, questions, observations
- **Thread**: Deep dives, tutorials, stories, frameworks
- **Quote tweet**: Commentary on others' content
- **Poll**: Engagement driver, opinion gathering

## Engagement Tactics
- Ask questions ("What's your take?")
- Make bold claims people want to respond to
- Use "This:" or "Unpopular opinion:" format for hot takes
- Respond to replies (algorithm rewards engagement)

## What NOT to Do
- Don't use 3+ hashtags (looks like spam)
- Don't write long single tweets that feel cramped
- Don't thread when a single tweet would do
- Don't be bland or generic (the timeline is ruthless)
- Don't include links in the main tweet (kills reach) -- put in reply
