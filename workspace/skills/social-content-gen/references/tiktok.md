# TikTok Content Rules

## Description Limits
- **Maximum**: 2,200 characters
- **Ideal**: 150-300 characters (users scan quickly)
- The video itself carries the content; description supports it

## Description Structure
1. **Hook** (first 5 words are everything -- this shows in the feed)
2. **Context or value prop** -- what the viewer will learn/see
3. **CTA** -- follow, like, comment, duet, stitch, save
4. **Hashtags** -- trending + niche mix

## Hashtag Strategy
- 3-6 relevant hashtags
- Include at least 1 trending hashtag when relevant
- Common discovery tags: #fyp #foryou #foryoupage (debated but still used)
- Niche-specific hashtags for targeted reach
- Trending sound/challenge hashtags when applicable

## Formatting
- Short, punchy sentences
- All caps for emphasis words (not full sentences)
- Emojis as visual breaks and energy
- No paragraph structure -- keep it scannable

## Tone & Style
- **Gen-Z friendly, informal, energetic**
- Authentic and unpolished is preferred over curated
- Humor, relatability, and shock value drive views
- Trend-aware language (but avoid outdated slang)
- Common formats:
  - "POV: [scenario]"
  - "Wait for it..."
  - "Things nobody tells you about [X]"
  - "This is your sign to [X]"
  - "Day [N] of [doing something]"

## Content Type Variations
- **Video description**: Accompanies the video, hooks scrollers
- **Photo carousel caption**: Multiple images with story or tips
- **Text overlay script**: Hook-heavy, designed for on-screen text

## Engagement Tactics
- "Comment [X] for [Y]" CTAs drive massive engagement
- "Follow for part 2" creates anticipation
- Ask questions that people can answer in 1-2 words
- Reference trending sounds/audio when relevant
- Duet/stitch invitations

## What Works
- First 3 seconds determine if the viewer stays
- Describe what happens in the video (hooks curiosity)
- Controversy and strong opinions (respectfully)
- Tutorials and "how to" in under 60 seconds
- Before/after transformations

## What NOT to Do
- Don't write essay-length descriptions (nobody reads them)
- Don't use formal or corporate language
- Don't ignore current trends (TikTok is trend-driven)
- Don't forget the hook -- if the first line is boring, they scroll
- Don't use hashtags that don't match the content
