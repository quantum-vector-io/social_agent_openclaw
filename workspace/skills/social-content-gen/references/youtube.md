# YouTube Content Rules

## Title
- **Maximum**: 100 characters
- **Ideal**: 60-70 characters (avoids truncation in search/sidebar)
- Front-load the primary keyword
- Use numbers when relevant ("7 Ways to...", "Top 10...", "In 5 Minutes")
- Power words: Ultimate, Complete, Secret, Free, How to, Why, Best
- Include the year for evergreen/updated content ("Guide 2026")

## Description
- **Maximum**: 5,000 characters
- **First 2-3 lines** appear in search results and above "Show more"

## Description Structure
1. **Hook paragraph** (lines 1-3): What the video covers, with primary keywords naturally included. This is your SEO goldmine.

2. **Timestamps / Chapters**:
   ```
   0:00 - Introduction
   1:23 - First Topic
   3:45 - Second Topic
   5:12 - Key Takeaway
   ```

3. **Links section**: Resources, tools, social media profiles, affiliate links

4. **About section**: Brief channel/creator description

5. **Keywords paragraph**: Natural-sounding paragraph with secondary keywords (not stuffed)

6. **Hashtags**: 3 maximum, placed after the description

## SEO Focus
- Primary keyword in: title, first 25 words of description, tags
- Use natural language -- Google penalizes keyword stuffing
- Include common search queries people would use to find this content
- Long-tail keywords in description body
- Tags are less important now but still useful (10-15 tags)

## Tone Variations
- **Tutorial/How-to**: Professional, clear, step-by-step
- **Entertainment**: Energetic, personality-driven
- **Vlog**: Authentic, casual, personal
- **Review**: Balanced, detailed, trustworthy
- **Listicle**: Structured, scannable, value-packed

## Title Formulas That Work
- "How to [Result] in [Timeframe]"
- "[Number] [Things] That [Outcome]"
- "I Tried [Thing] for [Duration] - Here's What Happened"
- "The [Adjective] Guide to [Topic]"
- "[Topic] Explained in [Time]"
- "Why [Common Belief] Is Wrong"
- "Stop [Doing This] - Do [This] Instead"

## Thumbnail Considerations
- Mention thumbnail content in description when relevant
- Face + text + bright colors = highest CTR
- Keep text to 3-5 words max on thumbnail

## What NOT to Do
- Don't write clickbait titles that don't deliver
- Don't keyword-stuff the description
- Don't skip timestamps (viewers and YouTube love them)
- Don't forget to include a CTA ("subscribe", "like", "comment")
- Don't use more than 3 hashtags (looks spammy)
- Don't leave the description empty or minimal
