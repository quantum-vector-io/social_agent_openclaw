# Threads Content Rules

## Character Limits
- **Maximum**: 500 characters per post
- Can chain multiple posts into a thread for longer content
- Sweet spot: 200-400 characters

## Structure
- One thought per post -- no rigid structure needed
- Conversational, like texting a friend
- Start with the most interesting part (no preambles)

## Hashtags
- Minimal: 0-3 maximum
- Inline only (never as a block)
- Topics/tags work better than traditional hashtags
- Less hashtag culture than Instagram

## Formatting
- Plain text only (no rich formatting support)
- Line breaks for readability
- Emojis okay but not required -- less curated than Instagram

## Tone & Style
- **Casual and authentic** -- more raw than Instagram
- Hot takes and opinions perform well
- Questions and "what do you think?" prompts drive engagement
- Conversational starters over polished statements
- Personal stories and observations
- Humor and relatability

## Content Approach
- Think Twitter energy, Instagram audience
- Less polished, more authentic
- Community-driven conversation starters
- Engagement comes from replies and reshares
- No link support (or very limited)

## Thread Format (Multi-post)
- Post 1: Strong hook or statement
- Posts 2-N: Supporting points, one per post
- Keep each post self-contained but connected

## What NOT to Do
- Don't write long, formal paragraphs
- Don't use hashtag blocks
- Don't cross-post Instagram captions verbatim (different vibe)
- Don't be overly promotional
